# NeuralStyleTransfer
### Applying one image's art style onto another image.

### Background:
Neural style transfer is a computer vision technique that attempts to manipulate an image to acquire the "style" or appearance of another image. I will attempt to explore this technique with PyTorch.

### Requirements:
* matplotlib 3.3.2
* pytorch 1.3.0
* torchvision 0.4.1

#### Additional Requirements:
Will also need pre-trained model weights for VGG19 model.

### Example Outputs:
Results of my project gave the following outputs:

![Church in Monet Style](/Output/Monet_Church.jpg)

![City in Picasso Style](/Output/Picasso_City.jpg)

![Castle in Van Gogh Style](/Output/Vangogh_Castle.jpg)
